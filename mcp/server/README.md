The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.

### Prerequisites

1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)

### Install in VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.

Alternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:

<table>
<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>
<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {

    }
  }
}
```

    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.

### Configuration

#### Toolset configuration

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### Insiders Mode

> **Try new features early!** The remote server offers an insiders version with early access to new features and experimental tools.

<table>
<tr><th>Using URL Path</th><th>Using Header</th></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/insiders"
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-MCP-Insiders": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md#insiders-mode) for more details and examples, and [Insiders Features](docs/insiders-features.md) for a full list of what's available.

#### GitHub Enterprise

##### GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.

Example for `https://octocorp.ghe.com` with GitHub PAT token:

```
{
    ...
    "github-octocorp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}"
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

> **Note:** When using OAuth with GitHub Enterprise with VS Code and GitHub Copilot, you also need to configure your VS Code settings to point to your GitHub Enterprise instance - see [Authenticate from VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/authenticate-to-ghecom)

##### GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The Docker image is available at `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.
3. **Authentication.** On github.com you don't need to create anything up front — the one-click buttons above log you in with OAuth on first use (a browser-based flow; the token is kept in memory only). The Docker buttons publish a fixed callback port (`127.0.0.1:8085`) so the container's login callback is reachable. See **[Local Server OAuth Login](docs/oauth-login.md)** for how it works, headless/device-code fallback, and bringing your own OAuth or GitHub App (required for GitHub Enterprise Server and `ghe.com`).

   Prefer a token? You can still authenticate with a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) by setting `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` instead (it takes precedence over OAuth). The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

To keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:

1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Protect your `.env` file**

   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Reference the token in configurations**

   ```bash
   # CLI usage
   claude mcp add github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT -- docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

   # In config files (where supported)
   "env": {
     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_PAT"
   }
   ```

> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
  - `repo` - Repository operations
  - `read:packages` - Docker image access
  - `read:org` - Organization team access
- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments
- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically
- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control
- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens

  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json
  ```

</details>

### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.
- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.

``` json
"github": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_HOST",
    "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}",
        "GITHUB_HOST": "https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>"
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

Install in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)

Add one of the following JSON blocks to your IDE's MCP settings.

**Log in with OAuth (no token to create or store).** On github.com the official image already includes the app credentials, so you provide none yourself: it runs a browser-based login on first use and keeps the resulting token **in memory only**. In Docker this needs a fixed callback port published to loopback so the container's login callback is reachable:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-p",
          "127.0.0.1:8085:8085",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT": "8085"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See **[Local Server OAuth Login](docs/oauth-login.md)** for the native-binary flow (no fixed port needed), the headless/device-code fallback, GitHub Enterprise Server / `ghe.com`, and bringing your own OAuth or GitHub App.

For non-interactive stdio deployments, see **[GitHub App Authentication](docs/github-app-auth.md)**.

**Or authenticate with a Personal Access Token.** Set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` instead (it takes precedence over OAuth):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "github_token",
        "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.

{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "github_token",
      "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [

      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}

- **[Zed](docs/installation-guides/install-zed.md)** - Installation guide for Zed editor

For a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.

> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.

### Build from source

If you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "/path/to/github-mcp-server",
        "args": ["stdio"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### CLI utilities

The `github-mcp-server` binary includes a few CLI subcommands that are helpful for debugging and exploring the server.

- `github-mcp-server tool-search "<query>"` searches tools by name, description, and input parameter names. Use `--max-results` to return more matches.
Example (color output requires a TTY; use `docker run -t` (or `-it`) when running in Docker):
```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server tool-search "issue" --max-results 5
github-mcp-server tool-search "issue" --max-results 5
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

> **Looking for examples?** See the [Server Configuration Guide](./docs/server-configuration.md) for common recipes like minimal setups, read-only mode, and combining tools with
